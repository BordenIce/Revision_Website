				<h4>Purpose of Systems Design, Development, and Testing</h4>
				<p>
					Systems design, development, and testing are critical stages in creating an effective software system. 
					The <strong class="highlight">design phase</strong> focuses on outlining the architecture, components, 
					and interfaces of the system, ensuring it meets both functional and non-functional requirements. 
					The <strong class="highlight">development phase</strong> involves coding and building the actual 
					system based on the design specifications, converting abstract ideas into functional software. 
					Finally, the <strong class="highlight">testing phase</strong> ensures that the developed system 
					works as expected, is free from defects, and meets the defined requirements. 
					Testing also helps to identify and fix any issues that could affect the system’s performance, 
					reliability, or usability, ensuring that the final product is of high quality and ready for deployment.
				</p>
			</section>		
			<section class="paragraph_righ">
				<h4>Use of Storyboarding in Developing the User Interface</h4>
				<p>
					<strong class="highlight">Storyboarding</strong> is a technique used in the design phase to 
					visualize the flow and structure of a user interface (UI). It involves creating a series 
					of sketches or screens that show how users will interact with the system, providing a clear 
					picture of the user journey. Storyboards help designers plan the layout, navigation, and 
					overall aesthetic of the UI, making it easier to ensure that the interface is intuitive 
					and user-friendly. This technique is particularly useful for identifying potential usability 
					issues early in the process and for gathering feedback from stakeholders before actual development begins.
				</p>
			</section>		
			<section class="paragraph_left">
				<h4>Use of Prototyping in UI and Data Model Design</h4>
				<p>
					<strong class="highlight">Prototyping</strong> involves creating a working model of the 
					system’s user interface (UI) and data model to demonstrate how the system will function. 
					Prototypes can range from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity, interactive mockups. 
					In UI design, prototyping allows designers to test different layouts, styles, and user 
					interactions to ensure that the interface is both functional and visually appealing. 
					In data model design, prototypes help developers understand how data will be structured, 
					stored, and accessed in the system. Prototyping is essential for getting early feedback 
					from users and stakeholders, allowing for iterative improvements before full-scale development begins.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="paragraph_right">
				<h4>Importance of Testing for System Quality</h4>
				<p>
					<strong class="highlight">Testing</strong> is crucial throughout the development process 
					to ensure system quality. It helps in identifying and correcting defects, verifying that 
					the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, and ensuring that the 
					system performs reliably under various conditions. 
					Testing also improves the system’s security, performance, and user experience. 
					By conducting regular tests during development, teams can catch and fix issues early, 
					reducing the cost and time required for corrections later in the project. 
					This ensures that the final system is stable, efficient, and ready for deployment.

				<h3>Types of Testing: Detailed Overview</h3>
				<p>There are several types of testing that play a crucial role in the software development 
					life cycle, each serving a distinct purpose in ensuring the system's reliability, functionality, 
					and performance.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="type_testing_description">
				<div class="type1">
					<h4>System Testing</h4>
					<div class="type_content">
						<img src="./images/System Testing.png" alt="System Testing">
						<p>System testing is a critical phase where the entire integrated system is tested as a 
							
							whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. It involves checking the interactions between different components and ensuring that they work together seamlessly. This type of testing covers functional aspects, such as checking whether features perform as expected, as well as non-functional aspects like performance, security, and usability. It helps identify defects that may only appear when the system is fully integrated, ensuring that the system behaves correctly in its intended environment.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="type2">
					<h4>Acceptance Testing</h4>
					<div class="type_content">
						<div class="type_content_text">
							<p>Acceptance testing is conducted by the end users or clients to determine whether the system meets their needs and business requirements. This is often the final stage of testing before the system is deployed to production. Acceptance testing ensures that the system delivers the expected functionality and is ready for real-world use. It can be divided into two main categories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Performed by the end users to ensure the system meets their functional expectations and is user-friendly.</li>
							<li>Business Acceptance Testing (BAT): Focuses on validating that the system aligns with the business's objectives and can support operational workflows.</li>
						</ul>
						</div>

				<div class="type3">
					<h4>Alpha Testing</h4>
					<div class="type_content">
						<img src="./images/Alpha Testing.png" alt="Alpha Testing">
						<p>Alpha testing is an internal testing process that is carried out by the development team or quality assurance team before the system is released to external users. The goal of alpha testing is to identify and fix bugs, usability issues, and other defects in a controlled environment. This testing is done at the early stages of development to ensure that the system works as intended before progressing to the next stages of testing. Alpha testing often involves rigorous testing of the entire system, focusing on finding as many issues as possible.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="type4">
					<h4>Beta Testing</h4>
					<div class="type_content">
						<p>Beta testing follows alpha testing and involves releasing the system to a small group of external users, who test the system in real-world conditions. Unlike alpha testing, beta testing occurs in a live environment where the system is exposed to real users and their interactions. The main goal of beta testing is to gather feedback on the system's performance, usability, and any remaining bugs. This feedback helps the development team make final improvements before the full product launch. Beta testing is an essential step in validating that the system meets user expectations and functions correctly in a variety of environments.</p>

		<section id="test_data">
			<div class="types_test_data">
				<p>Normal data refers to the standard or expected inputs that the system will process during typical operations. These inputs fall within the regular operating conditions of the system, representing the kinds of data that users would commonly provide. By testing with normal data, you ensure that the system functions correctly under usual conditions, handling everyday scenarios as intended.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="types_test_data">
				<p>Boundary data is used to test how the system responds to inputs that are at the extremes or limits of what is considered acceptable. This data type ensures that the system can handle edge cases and doesn't break or behave unpredictably when the inputs are at their maximum or minimum allowable values. For example, if a system accepts numbers from 1 to 100, boundary data would include inputs like 1, 100, and possibly values just outside the boundary, such as 0 or 101.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="types_test_data">
				<p>Erroneous data  involves inputs that are invalid or outside the acceptable range. These might be incorrectly formatted, out of scope, or nonsensical inputs. Testing with erroneous data is crucial to ensure that the system responds properly to mistakes or unexpected input. The system should not crash or produce incorrect results; instead, it should handle the errors gracefully, typically by displaying an appropriate error message or rejecting the input altogether.
